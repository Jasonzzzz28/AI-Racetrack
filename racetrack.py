    - h should be a heuristic function of three arguments h(s,f_line,walls), where
        s is the current state, f_line is the finish line, walls is a list of walls
    - verbose should be one of the following:
        0 - silent, just return the answer.
        1 - print some statistics at the end of the search.
        2 - print brief info at each iteration, and statistics at the end of the search.
        3 - print additional info at each iteration, and stats at the end of the search.
        4 - print the above, and pause at each iteration.
    - draw should either be 0 (draw nothing) or 1 (draw everything)
