This file contains a Racetrack heuristic function h_nmoves(state,fline,walls). 
It returns the number of moves that would be needed to reach the finish line
if there were no walls. The argumentsÂ are:

   - state is the current state. It should have the form ((x,y), (u,v)), where
      (x,y) is the current location and (u,v) is the current velocity.
   - fline is the finish line. It should have the form ((x1,y1), (x2,y2)), 
      where (x1,y1) and (x2,y2) are the two endpoints, and it should be either
      either vertical (x1 == x2) or horizontal (y1 == y2).
   - walls is a list of walls, each wall having the form ((x1,y1), (x2,y2)).
   
Unlike the heuristic functions in heuristic.py, h_nmoves is admissible. However,
it demonstrates how admissibility can reduce efficiency. With h_nmoves, A* is
guaranteed to find optimal solutions, but A* will generate many more nodes
than it generates with the heuristic functions in heuristics.py.
