These are some made-by-hand test problems for Project 1

Here's a list of all the test problems in this file,
roughly in increasing order of difficulty:

[rect20, rect20a, rect20b, rect20c, rect20d, rect20e, rect50, wall8a, wall8b, \
    lhook16, rhook16a, rhook16b, spiral16, spiral24, pdes30, pdes30b, \
    rectwall8, rectwall16, rectwall32, rectwall32a, twisty0]

Each test problem is a list of the form [p0, finish, walls], where
   p0 is the starting point;
   finish is the finish line;
   walls is a list of walls.

If you want to see what one of the problems (say, rect20a) looks like,
you can do it like this:

   import sample_probs, tdraw
   tdraw.draw_problem(sample_probs.rect20a, title='rect20a')

If you have a heuristic named h1 in a file named heuristics.py, and you
want GBF to use it on rect20a, you can do it like this:

   import racetrack, sample_probs, heuristics
   racetrack.main(sample_probs.rect20a, 'gbf', heuristics.h1, 1, 1, 'rect20a')
