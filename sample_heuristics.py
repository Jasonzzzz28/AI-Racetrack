Last updated: Sept 5, 2019

This file contains three heuristic functions for the Racetrack domain:
- h_edist returns the Euclidean distance to the goal, ignoring walls;
- h_esdist modifies h_edist to include an estimate of how long it will take to stop;
- h_walldist computes the approximate distance to the goal without ignoring walls. 

 Each heuristic function takes three arguments: state, fline, walls.
   - state is the current state. It should have the form ((x,y), (u,v)), where
      (x,y) is the current location and (u,v) is the current velocity.
   - fline is the finish line. It should have the form ((x1,y1), (x2,y2)), 
      where (x1,y1) and (x2,y2) are the two endpoints, and it should be either
      either vertical (x1 == x2) or horizontal (y1 == y2).
   - walls is a list of walls, each wall having the form ((x1,y1), (x2,y2))

None of the above heuristic functions is admissible. There's an admissible one in
the file nmoves.py, but (as explained in that file) I don't recommend using it.
