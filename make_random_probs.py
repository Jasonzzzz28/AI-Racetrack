Last updated: April 18, 2019 (modified to increase minimum distance between walls)

Some code to make random racetrack problems. It doesn't do a very good job,
and I'll look for a way to replace it with something better.

The main program creates problems and prints them to standard output, so if you 
want to put them in a file you should either cut-and-paste from the command-line 
window or redirect standard output.

Each randomly generated problem is on a square grid with some randomly generated
obstacles, so they look pretty different from the ones in sample_probs.py. 
They also are a bit flaky, e.g., sometimes the finish line will partially overlap
some of the obstacles.

    Then, so the distance between adjacent walls won't be too small, multiply all
    coordinates by 4, to get a racetrack of dimensions size x size.
